# GAMES-WITH-CPP-AND-SFML
A mini collection of 4 games I made using C++ and Simple Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for animations, graphics and audio in Visual Studio 2019.
I have classified the games for one player and two players and created menus for them.

**SNAKE GAME**
1. A simple snake game made using c++ and SFML in visual studio.
2. The aim is simple, make the snake as long as possible by eating the snack, its length increases by one block as snake eats the snack.
3. The game is over if snake hits the boundaries and loses a life if it collides with itself and as lives become 0, game is finished.
4. The game can be restarted by pressing 'R' and paused using 'P'.

**CONNECT-4 GAME**
1. A simple CONNECT-4 game that can be played between 2 players.
2. The rules are the same as the normal connect-4 game. We have two players with 2 different coloured circular pieces, here i used yellow and red. The player that          obtains 4 same coloured pieces consecutively in a row or column or diagonally, wins.
3. Each player can move by dropping his piece which hovers above the board with the mouse. 
4. By clicking above the particular column in which the piece is to be dropped, one can move its turn.
5. The game ends as soon as one of the player wins or the game draws and the window displays the winner colour, game can be restarted by using 'R' key.
6. Below is a visual representation of the game.
